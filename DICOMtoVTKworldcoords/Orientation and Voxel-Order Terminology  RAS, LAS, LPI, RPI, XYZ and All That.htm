<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In dealing with MRI data it's necessary to be familiar with the conventions 
and terminology used to describe orientation. It's also necessary to be aware of 
a number of common differences of custom, and various traps for the unwary. </p>
<p>The following is my effort to get all of this straight. It is a work in 
progress. Even where something's correct in my mind, it's incredibly easy to 
write it down backwards by mistake. Feel free to send rebuttals to 
raslasxyz@wideman-one.com</p>

vocabulary regarding directions.</p>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>&quot;Up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;front&quot;, &quot;back&quot;</b> are not used because they have 
  confusing meanings when dealing with patients in different orientations (eg: 
  lying down), or when dealing with other animals.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Medial, Lateral: </b>Because the left and right halves of the brain are 
  almost mirror images, it's useful to have:<br>
  &quot;medial&quot;: towards the middle of the R-L axis, on either side, and<br>
  &quot;lateral&quot;: away from the middle of the R-L axis on either side.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Directions are given relative to the patient.</b> (&quot;Right&quot; is patient's 
  right.) If we need to talk about location on a screen it's important to 
  distinguish carefully -- so we might say that patient-right appears on 
  screen-left.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Axes for Spatial Coordinates</h3>
<p>To talk about locations in space in the neighborhood of the brain, we need to 
be able to talk more precisely about sets of axes, including which direction is 
positive, and which order we are going to list them when describing a point's 
coordinates.&nbsp; There are three axes, which could be used in any order, and 
where either direction could be positive, so that gives us a total of 3 * 2 * 1 
* 2 ^ 3 = 48 possible axis schemes. </p>
<p>In MRI practice it seems that two of these schemes are most popular:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="RAS.gif" width="120" height="170"></td>
    <td><img border="0" src="LAS.gif" width="165" height="170"></td>
    <td><img border="0" src="soc_orientation.jpg" width="155" height="192"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&quot;Neurological&quot; convention for axes, aka &quot;RAS&quot;</td>
    <td>&quot;Radiological&quot; convention for axes, aka &quot;LAS&quot;</td>
    <td>Head orientation reference</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><b>Subtle points:</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Direction <i>and</i> Order</b>:&nbsp; Note that each convention 
  specifies not just the positive direction of three axes, but also the order 
  for listing them (eg: LAS, but not ALS). <br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Right-hand vs Left-hand:</b> Note that RAS is a right-hand coordinate 
  system (thumb = R, 2nd finger = A, middle finger = S.), whereas LAS is a 
  left-hand coordinate system. This is significant when performing matrix and 
  vector math, where a right-hand coordinate system is customarily used (though 
  a left-hand system can be used with appropriate adjustments).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>LSA? </b>The L, A and S axes <i>could</i> provide a right-hand 
  coordinate system if used in the order LSA for example, but nobody seems in 
  favor of this (but see the X, Y, Z topic below!).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Viewing Direction:</b> In the figures above, I've shown them as viewed 
  looking toward the patient's face. However there are also conventions for 
  viewing, wherein the Neurological view would be from above/behind the patient, 
  hence showing patient left on screen left. More on that below.</li>
</ul>
<h3>X, Y, Z for Spatial Axes</h3>
<p>In some contexts, brain data is placed in an X, Y, Z coordinate system, 
perhaps like this:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="xyz_01.GIF" width="176" height="164"></td>
    <td><img border="0" src="xyz_02.GIF" width="121" height="163"></td>
    <td><img border="0" src="xyz_lh.GIF" width="176" height="163"></td>
    <td><img border="0" src="soc_orientation.jpg" width="155" height="192"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Would be described as<b> LSA</b>:<br>
    +X = L<br>
    +Y = S<br>
    +Z = A</td>
    <td>2. Would be described as <b>RAS</b>:<br>
    +X = R<br>
    +Y = A<br>
    +Z = S</td>
    <td>3. Would be described as <b>LAS</b>:<br>
    +X = L<br>
    +Y = A<br>
    +Z = S</td>
    <td valign="top">Head orientation reference</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>LSA: </b>Attractive perhaps at first glance to a graphics programmer, 
  and of course you can do whatever you want inside your own program -- but does 
  not seem to enjoy wide use as a way to discuss brain coordinates.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>RAS: </b>Corresponds to the Neurologist-preferred RAS axes, and is a 
  right-hand system<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>LAS: </b>Corresponds to Radiologist-preferred LAS axes, and is a 
  left-hand system (ie: don't automatically assume that if X, Y and Z are being 
  used that you are looking at a right-hand coordinate system.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Why bother renaming perfectly good axes using X, Y, Z, why not just call them 
R, A, S or whatever? A couple of possible reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some environments for manipulating points or images perhaps require you to 
  state coordinates in X, Y, Z dimensions.</li>
  <li>When labeled as X, Y, Z, it's obvious in what order you should state the 
  coordinates (alphabetical), whereas with R, A and S floating around they might 
  be more prone to listing in the wrong order.</li>
</ul>
<h3>MRI Image File Voxel Ordering</h3>
<p>A number of MRI file formats involve storing voxel intensities as simply a 
stream of intensity numbers in to a file in some agreed-upon manner.&nbsp; 
(Examples: Analyze; AFNI).&nbsp; These formats require recording a number of 
characteristics of the image file, including voxel order, type of number used 
for intensity, and other attributes relating to conditions of image acquisition, 
processing steps that have been performed and so on. </p>
<p>In this discussion we are interested in the topic of voxel order.</p>
<p>In general terms, voxels are stored in sequence traveling along a&nbsp; row, 
one row after row another, one slice after slice another. But which directions 
are the rows and slices?</p>
<p>Like the case of the three axes, we again have a choice of 48 possible 
different storage orders. Here are some: </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Storage order in file</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Slice orientation <br>
    (ambiguous)</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>3-Letter <br>
    &quot;from&quot; Name</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Increasing position in file is in <br>
    direction of spatial axes...</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">R-L within P-A within I-S </td>
    <td valign="top">&quot;Axial&quot;</td>
    <td valign="top">RPI</td>
    <td valign="top">LAS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">L-R within P-A within I-S</td>
    <td valign="top">&quot;Axial&quot;</td>
    <td valign="top">LPI</td>
    <td valign="top">RAS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">R-L within S-I within P-A</td>
    <td valign="top">&quot;Coronal&quot;</td>
    <td valign="top">RSP</td>
    <td valign="top">LIA</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Storage Order: </b>R-L within P-A within I-S means:
  <ul>
    <li>Voxels ordered from right to left to store a row</li>
    <li>Rows ordered from posterior to anterior to store a slice (corrected 
    2004-02-13, thanks JR!)</li>
    <li>Slices stored from inferior to superior to store a volume<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Common 3-Letter Name vs Spatial Direction: </b>My current strong 
  impression is that it's customary to refer to a particular voxel order by 
  using the &quot;from&quot; letters of the three from-to pairs. This is not universal -- 
  some people refer to a particular voxel ordering by stating the spatial 
  direction of increasing index. This situation is error-inviting, as the two 
  different naming scheme are opposite.<br>
&nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>Repeat: Terminology is Tricky! </b>For example, data files commonly 
  described as using &quot;RPI&quot; voxel order store voxels in order of increasing LAS,
  <i>not increasing RPI</i> as might be expected at first glance.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Slice Orientation names:</b> There are names for the three possible 
  slice planes, but these do no specify the +/- directions of their axes so are 
  suggestive but&nbsp; insufficient to describe the order of voxels in a file:<ul>
    <li>Axial (Transverse): R-L x A-P plane</li>
    <li>Coronal: R-L x S-I plane</li>
    <li>Sagittal: A-P x S-I plane<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>&quot;Radiological&quot; vs &quot;Neurological&quot; Orientation in Viewers</h3>
<p>&quot;Radiological&quot; and &quot;Neurological&quot; identify two different conventions for the 
orientation of <i>views</i> of MRI slices. So far as I can tell, they mean the 
following:</p>

<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Some Fudging on Neuro View:</b> In truth, I haven't actually seen a 
  viewer that says explicitly that it's showing an official Neurological view. 
  I'm surmising the Neurological views from the observation that Neurological 
  adherents seem satisfied to use a Radiological-convention viewer when they 
  flip the R-L order of their raw data.&nbsp; Certainly software that shows 
  patient-right on screen-left is generally said to be using the Radiological 
  convention, whereas showing patient-right on the screen-right is said to be 
  Neurological convention. (This most-important distinction is highlighted in 
  yellow above).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>View Unrelated to Coordinate Axes: </b>So far as I have observed, the 
  Radiological vs Neurological <i>view</i> issue has little necessary tie to the 
  Radiological vs Neurological <i>coordinates</i> issue.&nbsp; It does not seem 
  to be the case, for example, that a Radiological viewer presents the three 
  slice views looking consistently <i>towards</i> the Radiological axes L, A, 
  and&nbsp; S, or consistently <i>away</i> from L, A and S.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Of course, a particular viewer might have readouts or labels for coordinates, 
  and it would be important to know whether it is reporting LAS or RAS numbers, 
  but those numbers could be reported while looking at either kind of view. (... 
  which is exactly the case in FreeSurfer's tkmedit -- patient-left is on 
  screen-right Radiological-style, and there's a Neuro-style RAS readout and RAS 
  coordinates are used for surfaces.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interpreting Voxel Order from Viewer -- Difficult</h3>
<p>Given the various schemes for storing data, and the possibility for voxel 
order to go awry, it's essential to be able to cross-check the actual stored 
voxel order unambiguously. Surely you can use one of many viewers to do that?</p>
<p>Actually, most viewers go to some effort to read a volume's header file, and 
orient the view in the most desirable fashion for viewing. This leaves you in 
the dark regarding the actual order of the data in the file, since it's usually 
not clear what helpful rotation the viewer has applied.</p>
<p>Here is an example Analyze volume as shown in <b>
<a href="http://www.cla.sc.edu/psyc/faculty/rorden/" name="ChrisRemail">Chris 
Rorden</a></b>'s popular <b>
<a href="http://www.cla.sc.edu/psyc/faculty/rorden/mricro.html">MRIcro MRI 
Viewer</a></b>. (The data is a
<a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~steve/ftp/avg152T1_LR-marked.tar.gz">test 
volume available</a> from the <a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/">FSL folks</a>, 
that is marked for left and right.)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="mricro_rl.GIF" width="428" height="255"></p>
<p>MRIcro has done a nice job of orienting the views in desirable way. We see 
that patient right is on the left of the image, so today we're Radiologists. 
(MRIcro has options for flipping.)&nbsp; But what does this tell us about the 
actual voxel order on disk?</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of my format-oblivious <a href="../tools/gworc/index.htm">
Orientation Reality Check</a> viewer that shows the raw data order:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gworc_rl.GIF" width="683" height="353"></p>
<p>We can see that voxels are ordered (R-L, P-A, I-S) (ie: RPI) in the file. We 
wouldn't want to study the MRI this way, but it does tell us that what we see in 
any particular smarter viewer is apt to obscure the raw data order.</p>
<h3>X, Y, Z MRI Array Indexes</h3>
<p>Returning to the topic of MRI files and arrays of voxels, some people use 
letters X, Y and Z when talking about voxel order. Here's a description from
<a href="http://www.fil.ion.bpmf.ac.uk/spm/distrib.html">SPM</a> regarding the 
voxel order of files:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>[...]after spatial normalisation, the images must be in the following 
  orientation: </i></p>
  <dl>
    <dt><i>X increases from Left to Right <br>
    Y increases from Posterior to Anterior <br>
    Z increases from Inferior to Superior</i></dt>
  </dl>
  <p><i>This is a right handed coordinate system, </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, let's realize the &quot;images must be in orientation&quot; translates to 
&quot;voxels must be in this order&quot;. Now, from preceding discussion, we can 
confidently expect that most people will refer to this voxel ordering as LPI, 
with some others referring to it as RAS. But it's also worth understanding what 
is the role of X, Y, Z in this picture. Here's my current opinion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They convey that the file is like an array: Voxels[X, Y, Z], where X is 
  the fastest-incrementing (innermost-nested) index, with voxels from Left to 
  Right etc etc. Ie: X, Y and Z are introduced just so as to have some index 
  variables, and they could just as well be I, J, K, or N0, N1, N2.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>X, Y, Z many have been chosen based on the idea that of course you are 
  going to stick these voxels into a 3-D space that's equipped with right-hand 
  X, Y and Z axes, and here's how to get the voxels into the correct locations. 
  (But some people are content with left-hand X, Y, Z axes...)</li>
</ul>
<h3>MRI File vs In-Memory Array</h3>
<p>Previous topic notwithstanding, if you were to actually read an MRI file into 
memory in one big blob and treat it as an array, it would probably be wrong to 
access it as: Voxels[X, Y, Z]. (Sticking with X being L-R and so on).</p>
<p>That's because in popular computer languages the first index is the 
slowest-incrementing index into memory. So instead we'd need to access that blob 
of memory as Voxels[Z, Y, X]&nbsp; (in C/C++:&nbsp; Voxels[Z][Y][X] )</p>
<h3>Radiological vs Neurological Voxel Orders</h3>
<p>The labels &quot;Radiological&quot; and &quot;Neurological&quot; are sometimes applied to 
particular orderings of voxels in a file. This is quite a surprise to a database 
analyst, for whom the physical arrangement of bytes in a file has no more to do 
with what those bytes mean than the issue of whether they are stored clockwise 
or counter-clockwise on a hard-drive -- so long as there's metadata on hand to 
inform us what that order is.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there has apparently been a history of viewers which slavishly 
copied bytes out of files and plotted them &quot;verbatim&quot; on screen from left to 
right, top to bottom, as this is the fastest way to get data from file to 
screen.</p>
<p>If voxel data is stored in a file from patient-right to patient-left, 
anterior to posterior, for example) , then when this is &quot;copied&quot; to the screen 
it places the patient's right on the left of the screen, and anterior at the 
top, the Radiological preference.</p>
<p>For the Neurological folks who want patient right on the right of the screen, 
one suspects that there was overwhelming temptation to achieve this effect in 
early slavishly-Radiological viewers by re-ordering the data. (Or maybe the 
rationale was to be able to load data into matrices in a particular order -- 
this would also motivate a desire for right-hand-organized data.) </p>
<p>As a consequence, we have the following terminology used by some:</p>

<h3>Caveat: More to the Story</h3>
<p>For sake of completeness: it should be noted that choices of axes and indices 
are only the coarsest issues when it comes to orientation, voxel order and 
position in space. In addition:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Often an MRI volume (especially a raw one) is not aligned to some exact 
  orthogonal direction. This emphasizes that the directions attributed to the 
  voxel array indices really can't be considered to be along particular spatial 
  axes. Nonetheless, it's useful to know which set of axes the voxel indices 
  correspond to most closely, as this helps when applying alignment or rotation 
  steps.</li>
  <li>There could be multiple volumes in a file, for example for multiple time 
  points.</li>
  <li>When a volume has been aligned to some particular direction and set of 
  axes, then of concern are:<ul>
    <li>The location of the origin</li>
    <li>Whether the origin is centered in the middle of some central voxel, or 
    on the corners of eight central voxels.</li>
    <li>Scaling (overall scaling, possible non-linear scaling)</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
